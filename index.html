    <h2>About the workshop</h2>
    <p>
        The International Workshop on Ontologies and Conceptual Modeling (OntoCom) is an academic workshop that focuses on 
        the practical and formal application of ontologies to conceptual modeling.  The importance of conceptual modeling 
        has grown over the years and it is now common to find examples of conceptual models being developed and used in a 
        range of diverse disciplines not related to computing including, for example, biology, business, construction and 
        engineering. Among the reasons for this disciplinary expansion is also the increasing digitalisation of all aspects 
        of modern life as well as the increased complexity that such digitalisation entails in terms of emerging needs and 
        requirements. The natural consequence is a proliferation of conceptual models of multiple real-world domains which 
        sooner or later require data and systems to interoperate and/or integrate. In this emerging scenario ontology-driven 
        conceptual modeling becomes even more fundamental to modern life due to its intrinsic ability to represent reality 
        in a theoretically and semantically consistent manner. Foundational (or upper ontologies) have the potential to 
        resolve the difficult problems that derive from a lack of a consistent and sound ontological theory. The benefits 
        that can derive from the application of a foundational ontology include improved mapping to the real world domain, 
        increased level of communication and understanding among stakeholders, model reuse, semantic integration and 
        interoperability and increased overall efficiency and effectiveness of information systems development and evolution. 
        Foundational ontologies can also assist in overcoming the inscrutable nature of most mainstream artificial intelligence 
        methods (i.e. neural networks and machine learning). Contributions in the form of research, research-in-progress papers 
        and practitioner reports are welcome.    
    </p>
    <p>
The theme of OntoCom will continue to be Foundational Ontologies and their Meta-ontological Choices. The workshop will be practically oriented and discussions will be centred on models produced for different kinds of case studies. More specifically, we intend to provide several case studies that each focus on a concrete modelling problem. Next, during our workshop, we would discuss and clarify each of these case studies using several different foundational ontologies. The purpose of this discussion is to discover and evaluate how the different ontologies would distinguish themselves in representing each of these case studies and their respective problems. Consequently, this would lead to highly interesting discussions between experts of different kinds of ontologies. As such, this workshop is aimed at providing a platform to stimulate high expert discussions concerning the application of different kinds of foundational ontologies to a set of distinct modelling problems. 
    </p>
    <p>
The structure of the workshop would thus be as followed: we would accept contributions that concern the above-mentioned topics (or even on topics related to the main workshop theme) and demonstrate these contributions during SLAM sessions, or short power point presentations that explain the main idea of the paper. Contributions in the form of research, research-in-progress papers and practitioner reports are welcome. Next, our sessions would be focused on presenting several case studies and possible interpretations of these case studies by various foundational ontologies. Together with the audience, we would then discuss the advantages, disadvantages, main distinctions and possible changes in each of these representations by the foundational ontologies.
